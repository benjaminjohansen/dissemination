    "text": "Calibration\nVan Calster et al. (2019) If we fit a calibration curve, for example by fitting a logistic regression model to the predicted values and the actual observation (\\(1 = \\text{occured}\\), \\(0 =  \\text{didn't occur}\\)), we can get the intercept \\(\\alpha_{c}\\) and the slope \\(\\zeta\\). Where \\(\\alpha_{c}\\) is the calibration-in-the-large. \\[\\text{logit}(P(_{*}y_{i}=1|_*\\hat{\\pi}_{i}))=\\alpha+\\zeta\\text{logit}(_{*}\\hat{\\pi}_{i}) \\qquad(1)\\] A perfectly calibrated model will have an intecept \\(\\alpha = \\alpha_{c} = 0\\) and \\(\\zeta=1\\)\nWe can evaluate the calibration slope \\(\\zeta\\) to asses if the model is over- or underfitting. When \\(\\zeta &lt; 1\\) the model is overfitted, and when \\(\\zeta &gt; 1\\) the model is underfitted.\nTo calculate the calibration-in-the-large we fix the intercept at \\(1\\) and denote this a \\(\\alpha|\\zeta=1\\). We can then update equation Equation 1 to this form: \\[\\text{logit}(P(_{*}y_{i}=1|_{*}\\hat{\\pi}))=\\alpha_{c} + \\text{offset}(\\text{logit}(_{*}\\hat{\\pi}_{i})) \\qquad(2)\\] The calibration-in-the-large tells us if the risk on average is overstimated \\((\\alpha_{c}&lt;0)\\) or underestimated \\((\\alpha_{c}&gt;0)\\)\nImproving calibration by re-calibration, hyper parameter tuning, using regularization (LASSO)"

This includes both discrimination and calibration! You’ll be using hyperparameter tuning and cross validation for this step. In this step we’ll go a step further and implement a 10 loop bootstrap loop to see how our models differs on different subsets of training."
